* This repository contains a Flask web application for classifying images of cats and dogs using a pre-trained Keras model. The application allows users to upload an image and receive a prediction indicating whether the image is of a cat or a dog.

* Additionally using Docker , I've builded it and hosted locally. I've added screenshots for those as well
* Note that as model size is huge , I have given a [direct link](https://github.com/SaiNivedh26/Docker-Dog-Cat-Classification/blob/main/Model.txt) to drive where I've attached the model file
